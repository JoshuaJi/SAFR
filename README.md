This projectâ€™s purpose is to lay the foundation for a live model systems design which could enable the safe flight of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) over populated areas. As the main obstacle is currently regulation, this system takes a safety-first approach and addresses security concerns in order to maximize its likelihood of adoption by minimizing the likelihood of the occurrence of incidents that can cause bodily harm. This report summarizes the initial design that took place throughout the Fall 2016 semester and established the groundwork for an implementation in the Winter 2017 semester. The team was able to work from a high level design model (the V model). This allowed the team to define the needs of the end-user as well as the functional and non-functional requirements of the system which in turn led to the definition of more specific system requirements within a safety context. Using these, safety analysis was performed and an initial system design was developed. The eventual goal of the project will be create a software simulation environment where the system can be run and tested.
